# OpenFirmInstaller
Safe, simple, user-friendly installer for sighaxed FIRMs

OpenFirmInstaller is based on [SafeB9SInstaller](https://github.com/d0k3/SafeB9SInstaller) and works the same way as that. Input files go into `sdmc:/ofi`. At the present time, only [boot9strap](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap) and [fastboot3DS](https://github.com/derrekr/fastboot3DS) are supported.
