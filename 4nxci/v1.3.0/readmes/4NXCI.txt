4NXCI is a tool for converting XCI(NX Card Image) files to NSP  

4NXCI is based on [hactool](https://github.com/SciresM/hactool) by SciresM  
Thanks: SciresM, Rajkosto, Switch Brew

## Usage
You should load your keyset file with -k or --keyset option followed by a path to it or place your keyset file with "keys.dat" filename in the same folder as 4NXCI  
Required keys are:  

Key Name | Description
-------- | -----------
header_key | NCA Header Key
key_area_key_application_xx | Application key area encryption keys

Created NSP files are located in the same folder as 4NXCI with 'titleid.nsp' filename  
4NXCI creates "4nxci_extracted_xci" folder as a temp folder, you can remove it after the conversion is done

```
*nix: ./4nxci [options...] <path_to_file.xci>  
Windows: .\4nxci.exe [options...] <path_to_file.xci>  
  
Options:  
-k, --keyset             Set keyset filepath, default filepath is ./keys.dat  
-h, --help               Display usage
